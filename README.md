### Abstract
Mesh deformation is becoming an increasingly popular tool used within modern games. The aim of this project is to provide a simple and efficient take on the deformation of an arbitrary 3-dimensional mesh in order to create a simple tool for game developers. Two such deformations are provided, expansion and contraction, both based around the bisection of a mesh and a given plane. These deformations are also recorded by the developed tool, allowing for the reversal of any particular alteration. While performance of the tool on high poly-count meshes indicates room for improved efficiency, at low to mid poly-counts the tool allows for visually striking transformations of the meshes. Overall, the tool created is novel and robust, allowing for intuitive mechanics to be created in a game setting with little to no work for the developer.
